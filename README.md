# Visualization of Sorting Algorithms

<font style="color:#fff; font-family: 'Bebas Neue';

A GUI based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer using Python Tkinter Library.

## Abstract
    The idea behind this project is to compare the performance 
    of different algorithms while also visualizing them.

## Introduction

    The program I developed contains all the necessary features that satisfy the overall purpose of this project. It is Interactive 
    and has Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
    which makes it easy to use.

## Features and Working
    1. Ability to Select Desired Algorithms from Menu.

    2. Ability to Select Desired File Containing the Data from Menu.

    3. Ability to Select Speed of Sorting During Visualization.
    
    4. After Selecting the Desired Options, User can Click on Buttons to get the Desired Output.
    
    5. User Can See the Data being Sorted in Real time in form of Blue Sticks, Height of Stick represents the Size of the value.
    
    6. When all Sticks turn Green then it means Array is Sorted.
    
    7. After All the Data is Sorted then a New Window pops up, Showing the Final Sorted Array.
    
    8. User can also see Both Unsorted and Sorted Arrays printed on Console

* <b> Working of Buttons </b>

    1. "Generate Array from File" Button, Reads Data from the 
    Selected file.

    2. “Generate Random Array" Button, Creates Random Data 
    after Opening a new Dialog Box asking User to Enter Size of 
    Data to be generated.

    3. “Sort" Button, Starts Sorting the Data from Selected 
    Algorithm from Menu.

## Design and Tools

    This program is developed in “Python Programming Language". 
    Python is both convenient and very popular language among Scientists, Engineers and Programmers.
    Python has many Libraries to Achieve Different Tasks.
    For the GUI of this Program a library called “Tkinter" is used.
